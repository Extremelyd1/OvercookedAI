# OvercookedAI
A project for an computer-controlled/AI player for the game Overcooked! 2.
Currently the project is in a proof-of-concept state. As a proof to its validity, check [this video](https://youtu.be/bG4OlH_B1WQ).

The motivation behind this project is to practice reverse engineering, and with the use of mono-injection, implement a AI player for the game. Since the game is written in Unity, mono-injection is a simple method to allow code execution within the game in the form of C# scripts.
